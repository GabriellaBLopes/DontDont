 # A new language
 
 We use our digital devices so much throughout the day that we think we got it mastered. With our touch screens on the palm of our hands, we can get pretty much everything done with the tap of a finger.

 An entirely new and ever evolving gestural language is enabling us to message our friends at any time and listen to music everywhere. Weâ€™ve learned that we can pinch a picture to zoom it, and force touch a UI component to peek at its content.
 
 But not all designed interactions are so intuitive to us. A gesture that differs slightly from what is expected can cause a lot of confusion in the user experience.
 
 ## Donâ€™t Donâ€™t is a game that plays with just that: a lot of gestural confusion. ðŸ¤ª
 
 All you have to do is follow simple instructions and swipe in the correct direction. Iâ€™ll even give you a hint: beware of double negatives.
 
 Do you think youâ€™re smart enough for that? I challenge you. ðŸ§ 
 
 **Swipe right to play and good luck!**
