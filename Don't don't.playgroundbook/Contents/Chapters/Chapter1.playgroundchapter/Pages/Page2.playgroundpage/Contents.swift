 ## How did you do?
 I hope you got the chance to score at least 15 points and see the neat easter egg I implemented. ðŸ¤“
 
 ## Wondering how the game works?
 Anytime you were presented with instructions such as "Swipe right", some
 `UISwipeGestureRecognizer` instances looked for swiping in all four directions.
 
 The instruction you saw onscreen was only one of the two properties of the `Task` struct I created. The other property for each task was the expected user response for each instruction.
 
 When the `Task`â€™s expected user response and the actual swiping you performed matched, you scored!
 
 ## Go nuts! ðŸ¥œ
 Now that you understand how the `Task` struct works, you can add your own unique challenges to the game! Iâ€™ve added a few examples below, but feel free to create new ones and challenge your friends!
