Don't Don't is a Playground Book game coded in Swift, using SpriteKit and UISwipeGestureRecognizers. 

Don’t Don’t is a pretty simple game. All you have to do to score is swipe your finger to the correct direction. As you progress into the gameplay, you realize that this isn’t such an easy task. I’ve purposely placed several instructions that challenge the reflexes and logical thinking of players. When the clock is ticking and a double negative sentence shows up, it can be hard to figure out which way to swipe.

After experiencing the game itself, users can start (on page 2) to create their own unique tasks to challenge themselves and their friends.
